        <div className="about_text">After graduating from Syracuse University with a Bachelor of Architecture, Irene worked in the field for 7 years. Growing up, she had loved solving puzzles, math as well as the arts and design. Architecture felt like the right fit and so Irene decided to pursue a degree and to obtain her license in the state of New York. Working in the field, Irene enjoyed tackling different problems and putting her creative stamp on projects. Always eager to keep learning, Irene was introduced to software engineering. She started creating a couple of sites for her own use and quickly developed a love for what it could do.
Irene made the decision to pursue software engineering full time and enrolled in the Grace Hopper program at Fullstack Academy, which only solidified her interest even further. She is currently seeking a role in the front end doing work on UX/UI design.
